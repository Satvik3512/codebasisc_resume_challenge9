Atliq Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in Southern region of India. All
their 50 stores ran massive promotions during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 on
their AtliQ branded products. Now their Sales director wants to understand which 
promotions did well and which did not so they can make informed decissions for
their next promotional period.

For this project I have used MySQL workbench for running SQL queries; and PowerBI for data visualization.
